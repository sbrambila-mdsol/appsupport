Tokenization Process

Download Scenario runs

dbo.usp_Decrypt_Tokenize is executed on the PROCESSING server, passing the download scenario as input

dbo.usp_Decrypt_Tokenize uses importLog/tblMdDataFeed to find the files that need to be sent from the file server to the tokenization server

dbo.usp_Decrypt_Tokenize moves the files from the file server to the input directory for those files and deletes the original files from the file server. 

The following variables/settings, declard at the beginning of the SP, tell the SP where to input the files and where to find them once output by the tokenization process.

	DECLARE @TokenizationMaxWaitTime INT =( select cast(SettingValue as int) from tps_Dba.dbo.tblServerSetting where SettingName='TokenizationMaxWaitTime')
	DECLARE @OutputFolderTokenization VARCHAR(800) = ( select SettingValue from tps_Dba.dbo.tblServerSetting where SettingName='OutputFolderTokenization')
	DECLARE @InputFolderTokenization VARCHAR(800) = ( select SettingValue from tps_Dba.dbo.tblServerSetting where SettingName='InputFolderTokenization')
	-- DataFeedDescription may be used to specify further sub-directory folders for specific datafeeds

Meanwhile, on PRDSHFUPK1, [Run Tokenization] is scheduled to run every two minutes (on the even minutes) and executes Tokenization.dbo.uspCheckFilesToTokenize

Tokenization.dbo.uspCheckFilesToTokenize looks for files placed in the sub-directories of \\PRDSHFUPK1\Tokenization\input and will decrypt/de-identify/tokenize any files found there.

Once uspCheckFilesToTokenize finds a file in the input directory it will move that file to the working directory \\PRDSHFUPK1\Tokenization\working where the file will be processed.

Once that file has been decrypted, tokenized, and/or de-identified it is moved to the output directory: \\PRDSHFUPK1\Tokenization\output

Meanwhile usp_Decrypt_Tokenize has still been running on the PROCESSING server, looking for the files it sent over in the output directory.

Once usp_Decrypt_Tokenize finds those files it brings them back to the file server and removes them from the output directory. 

Typically, another process/scenario then imports those file.
